"WebSub provides a common mechanism for communication between publishers of "
"any kind of Web content and their subscribers, based on HTTP web hooks. "
"Subscription requests are relayed through hubs, which validate and verify "
"the request. Hubs then distribute new and updated content to subscribers "
"when it becomes available. WebSub was previously known as PubSubHubbub."
